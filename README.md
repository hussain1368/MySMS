# School Management System (SMS)

**Hello and welcome to my GitHub!**

This project is a desktop School Management System especially designed for Afghanistan context. I developed this project back in 2015 using Java. I have used Java Swing library for the GUI. I have also used MySQL as DBMS. The user interface is only in local languages and currently not in English. The software includes the following functional modules.

- Student and employee registration
- Courses and subjects
- Financial definitions
- Financial transactions
- Library
- User management
- Settings

Here, you can see a screenshot from the home page of the software.
